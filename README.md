# TilePuzzle
Solving tile puzzles with searching algorithms

Presented are 2 solvers for the sliding tile puzzle. One approach uses uninformed breadth first search,
the other approach uses a greedy best first search.

Priority first search was implemented using both a quaternary tree and an LCRS tree.
Breadth First Search example uses an LCRS tree. LCRS trees are a memory efficient alternative
to quaternary trees, whos structure lends themselves nicely to the this class of problem.
