# TilePuzzle
Solving tile puzzles with searching algorithms

Presented are solvers for the sliding tile puzzle. Implemented are Breadh First Search, 
Iterative Deepening Depth First Search, and priority first search.

Priority first search was implemented using both a quaternary tree and an LCRS tree.
IDDFS & Breadth First Search examples both use LCRS tree. LCRS trees are a memory efficient alternative
to quaternary trees, whos structure lends themselves nicely to the this class of problem.
